# üçΩÔ∏è Premium Fruit Bar Management System

A modern, comprehensive system built using the **TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire, Laravel)**. This application streamlines the operations of a premium fruit bar, specializing in fresh juices, fruit salads, and fruit-based desserts.

Key features include **dynamic product composition (build-your-own juices/items) powered by Livewire**, real-time inventory management linked to ingredients, order processing, and essential analytics for cost management and quality control. Designed initially for a small team, it emphasizes quality and customization.

## üöÄ Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Laravel (PHP 8.1+)
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+
- **Frontend & UI (Admin)**: Livewire & Alpine.js for dynamic interfaces.
- **Frontend & UI (Customer)**: Livewire for interactive menu display and product composition.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first)
- **Localization**: Built-in support (Arabic, French, English via JSON files).

## üîç System Architecture

The application leverages Livewire extensively for both the customer-facing interactions and the administrative backend, creating reactive interfaces with minimal JavaScript.

### Testing

The application uses Laravel Dusk for browser testing. Test screenshots are stored in the `tests/Browser/screenshots` directory. See the `tests/LIVEWIRE_TESTING.md` file for detailed instructions on running tests.

### 1. Admin Dashboard üõ†Ô∏è (Livewire + Alpine.js)

A comprehensive backend powered by Livewire components, enhanced with Alpine.js for minor frontend interactions.

#### Key Functionalities
- Real-time dashboard (`Admin\\Dashboard`).
- Management Modules (Livewire Components):
    - `ProductManagement`, `CategoryManagement`, `IngredientManagement`, `RecipeManagement`
    - `OrderManagement`, `KitchenManagement`, `KitchenDisplay`, `CashRegister\\Index`
    - `InventoryManagement`, `PurchaseManagement`, `SupplierManagement`
    - `ExpenseManagement`, `ExpenseCategories\\Index`, `WasteManagement`
    - `ComposableConfigurationManager` (Configures rules for custom products)
    - Settings, Languages, etc.
- Ingredient tracking, stock monitoring, and cost analysis.

#### Admin Workflow Example (Product Setup)
1. Define categories (`CategoryManagement`).
2. Configure composable rules per category (`ComposableConfigurationManager`) - e.g., Does it need a base? How many ingredients? What sizes are offered and what's their price multiplier?
3. Add ingredients (`IngredientManagement`), specifying cost, unit, stock, and if usable in compositions (`is_composable`).
4. Add standard products (`ProductManagement`), defining recipes using ingredients, setting price/cost. Mark products as `is_composable=true` if they serve as starting points for customization.

### 2. Customer Experience üçΩÔ∏è (Livewire)

The customer interface relies on Livewire for dynamic content loading and interactions.

#### Key Features & Components
- **Menu Display**: `MenuIndex` component shows available products (standard and composable starting points).
- **TV Display**: `TvMenu` offers a dedicated view for screen displays.
- **Product Composition**: `ComposableProductIndex` handles the interactive "build-your-own" process (see details below).
- **Shopping Cart**: `CartDrawer` manages the user's cart in real-time.
- **Order Tracking**: `OrderTrack` allows customers to view their order status.
- Multi-language support via Laravel localization.

---

### 3. Composable Product Feature

This core feature allows customers to build custom items (e.g., juices) interactively.

#### Key Components & Flow:
1.  **Initiation**: User selects a composable product type (e.g., "Juices") from the menu (`MenuIndex`). This loads the `ComposableProductIndex` Livewire component via the `/compose/{productType}` route.
2.  **Configuration Loading**: `ComposableProductIndex` fetches the `Category` and its linked `ComposableConfiguration` to determine the rules (required base/sugar/size, min/max ingredients, available sizes with price multipliers).
3.  **Interactive Selection**: The user selects ingredients, base, sugar, size, and addons using the UI managed by `ComposableProductIndex`. Available options (ingredients, bases) are filtered based on availability and the `is_composable` flag.
4.  **Real-time Price Calculation**: With each selection change, `ComposableProductIndex` calls the `ComposablePriceCalculator` service. This service calculates the price based on:
    *   Sum of selected ingredient costs (fetched from `Ingredient` model, potentially using price history or current price).
    *   Fixed costs for selected base and sugar (currently hardcoded in the service).
    *   Fixed cost per addon (currently hardcoded).
    *   Application of a size multiplier (from hardcoded values in the service, potentially diverging from `ComposableConfiguration`).
5.  **Add to Cart**: `ComposableProductIndex` validates the selection, generates a name, bundles the selected options (ingredients, base, size, etc.) and the final price into an array, and adds it to the session cart (`CartDrawer` updates).
6.  **Order Placement**: When the order is placed:
    *   An `Order` record is created.
    *   An `OrderItem` record is created for the custom item. The `OrderItem` stores:
        *   The final calculated `price`.
        *   The calculated `cost`.
        *   The detailed user selections (ingredients, base, size etc.) in a `details` or `composition` field (likely JSON).

### 4. Order Management üõí

#### Core Functionalities
- `Order` model tracks overall order details, status (`OrderStatus` enum), payment (`PaymentStatus`, `PaymentMethod` enums), totals, customer info.
- `OrderItem` model stores details of each item within an order, including the specific composition of custom-built products.
- Real-time updates possible via Livewire components (`Admin\\OrderManagement`, `KitchenDisplay`).
- Inventory deduction occurs during order placement (needs verification for accuracy, especially for composed items).
- Order cancellation includes logic placeholders for inventory restoration.

---

### 5. Analytics & Reporting üìä

- **Sales:** Track performance via `OrderItem` static methods (`getTopPerformers`, `getDailyRevenue`). Analyze peak hours, popular products, revenue trends.
- **Inventory:** `Ingredient` model includes methods for analyzing usage, wastage, turnover, and efficiency, likely relying on `StockLog` data (`calculateWastage`, `calculateTurnoverRate`, etc.). Services like `IngredientAnalyticsService` (mentioned previously) likely leverage these.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Core Models Overview

- **`Product`**: Represents sellable items. Can be standard (fixed recipe using `ingredients` relationship) or a starting point for customization (`is_composable=true`). Includes inventory (`HasInventory` trait) and pricing (`HasPricing` trait).
- **`Ingredient`**: Raw materials. Stores cost, stock (`HasInventory`), unit, expiry (`HasExpiry`), availability, and `is_composable` flag. Central to inventory control and costing.
- **`Category`**: Groups products and ingredients. Links to `ComposableConfiguration`.
- **`ComposableConfiguration`**: Defines the rules for building a composable product within a specific category (min/max ingredients, required steps, available sizes with price multipliers).
- **`Order`**: Header information for a customer order, including status, totals, and customer details.
- **`OrderItem`**: Line item within an order. Stores quantity, final price/cost. For composed items, stores the user's specific choices in a `details`/`composition` field.
- **`User`**: Standard user model for authentication.
- **`StockLog`**: (Inferred) Tracks adjustments to ingredient stock levels (usage, deliveries, waste). Used by `Ingredient` analytics methods.

*(Other models exist for Suppliers, Purchases, Expenses, Cash Registers, Recipes, etc.)*
